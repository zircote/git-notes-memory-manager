Fix status command to use project-specific index path
## Context
The `/memory:status` command was reporting 0 memories because it used `get_index_path()` (global legacy path) instead of `get_project_index_path()` (current project-specific path).

## Rationale
- Per-project isolation was added to store indexes in `<git-root>/.memory/index.db`
- The status command wasn't updated to use this new path
- All memories (352) are safe in the project index

- src/git_notes_memory/config.py:344-365 (get_project_index_path)
