Completed Task 1.2: Extended Memory model with domain field
## Summary
Added domain awareness to the Memory dataclass with backward-compatible defaults and convenience properties.

## Changes Made
- Added `domain: str = "project"` field to Memory dataclass
- Added `domain_enum` property returning Domain enum value
- Added `is_user_domain` and `is_project_domain` boolean properties
- Extended MemoryResult with same domain properties for uniform access
- Added 7 comprehensive tests for domain functionality

## Design Decision
Stored domain as string rather than enum for SQLite/JSON serialization compatibility. The `domain_enum` property provides type-safe access when needed.
