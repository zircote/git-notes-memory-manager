Task 1.1 complete: Add Domain Enum to Config
## Summary

## Changes Made
- Added `Domain` enum with `USER` and `PROJECT` values
- Added `get_user_memories_path(ensure_exists=False)` for bare repo location
- Added `get_user_index_path(ensure_exists=False)` for user index DB
- Added 17 new tests for domain configuration

Completed Task 1.2: Extended Memory model with domain field
## Summary
Added domain awareness to the Memory dataclass with backward-compatible defaults and convenience properties.

## Changes Made
- Added `domain: str = "project"` field to Memory dataclass
- Added `domain_enum` property returning Domain enum value
- Added `is_user_domain` and `is_project_domain` boolean properties
- Extended MemoryResult with same domain properties for uniform access
- Added 7 comprehensive tests for domain functionality

## Design Decision
Stored domain as string rather than enum for SQLite/JSON serialization compatibility. The `domain_enum` property provides type-safe access when needed.

Completed Phase 2: Storage Layer (Tasks 2.1-2.4) for multi-domain memories
## Summary
Implemented the complete storage layer for multi-domain memory support, enabling separation of user-level (global) and project-level memories.

## Changes Made
- **Task 2.1**: Added `GitOps.for_domain()` factory method with domain-specific caching
- **Task 2.2**: Implemented `ensure_user_repo_initialized()` for bare git repo at `~/.local/share/memory-plugin/user-memories/`
- **Task 2.3**: Added domain filter to `search_vector()` and `search_text()`
- **Task 2.4**: Added domain filter to `get_by_spec()`, `get_by_namespace()`, `list_recent()`, `count()`, and `get_stats()`
- Extended `IndexStats` model with `by_domain` field and `by_domain_dict` property
- Added 27 new tests (14 GitOps, 13 domain filter)

Completed Task 3.1: Extend CaptureService for Domain
## Summary
Added domain parameter to CaptureService.capture() method enabling multi-domain memory storage.

## Changes Made
- Added `domain: Domain = Domain.PROJECT` parameter to `capture()` method
- Updated `_do_capture()` to use `GitOps.for_domain(domain)` for USER domain
- Implemented correct memory ID format: `user:{namespace}:{sha}:{idx}` for USER domain
- Memory object now includes domain value for proper storage

Completed Task 3.3: RecallService multi-domain search
## Summary
Extended RecallService to support searching across both USER and PROJECT domains with merged results, deduplication, and proper ordering.

## Changes Made
- Added `domain: Domain | None = None` parameter to `search()` method
- Added `domain: Domain | None = None` parameter to `search_text()` method
- Implemented `_search_single_domain()` for single-domain queries
- Implemented `_search_both_domains()` for parallel query + merge
- Added `_get_user_index()` for lazy user index initialization
- Project results win at equal distance (tie-breaker)
- Deduplication by summary to avoid duplicates across domains
- Added 10 new domain-aware search tests (6 vector + 4 text)
- All 1904 tests pass

Completed Phase 2: Storage Layer (Tasks 2.1-2.4) for multi-domain memories
## Summary
Implemented the complete storage layer for multi-domain memory support, enabling separation of user-level (global) and project-level memories.

## Changes Made
- **Task 2.1**: Added `GitOps.for_domain()` factory method with domain-specific caching
- **Task 2.2**: Implemented `ensure_user_repo_initialized()` for bare git repo at `~/.local/share/memory-plugin/user-memories/`
- **Task 2.3**: Added domain filter to `search_vector()` and `search_text()`
- **Task 2.4**: Added domain filter to `get_by_spec()`, `get_by_namespace()`, `list_recent()`, `count()`, and `get_stats()`
- Extended `IndexStats` model with `by_domain` field and `by_domain_dict` property
- Added 27 new tests (14 GitOps, 13 domain filter)

Completed Task 3.1: Extend CaptureService for Domain
## Summary
Added domain parameter to CaptureService.capture() method enabling multi-domain memory storage.

## Changes Made
- Added `domain: Domain = Domain.PROJECT` parameter to `capture()` method
- Updated `_do_capture()` to use `GitOps.for_domain(domain)` for USER domain
- Implemented correct memory ID format: `user:{namespace}:{sha}:{idx}` for USER domain
- Memory object now includes domain value for proper storage

Completed Task 3.3: RecallService multi-domain search
## Summary
Extended RecallService to support searching across both USER and PROJECT domains with merged results, deduplication, and proper ordering.

## Changes Made
- Added `domain: Domain | None = None` parameter to `search()` method
- Added `domain: Domain | None = None` parameter to `search_text()` method
- Implemented `_search_single_domain()` for single-domain queries
- Implemented `_search_both_domains()` for parallel query + merge
- Added `_get_user_index()` for lazy user index initialization
- Project results win at equal distance (tie-breaker)
- Deduplication by summary to avoid duplicates across domains
- Added 10 new domain-aware search tests (6 vector + 4 text)
- All 1904 tests pass
