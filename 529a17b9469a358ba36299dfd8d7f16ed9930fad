Observability research complete - key patterns for implementation
## Summary
Research on Python observability best practices reveals clear patterns for optional dependencies and structured logging.

## Key Findings
- **OpenTelemetry**: Libraries should only depend on `opentelemetry-api`; SDK is application choice. Use `extras_require` for optional instrumentation.
- **Prometheus buckets**: Default 15 buckets (5ms-10s) suitable for web services; customize to align with SLOs (hook timeouts: 2s, 5s, 15s, 30s)
- **Structured logging**: structlog recommended for new projects - supports context binding, processors, and JSON output

## Related Files
- pyproject.toml (extras configuration)
- src/git_notes_memory/observability.py (planned)
