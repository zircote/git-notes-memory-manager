Hooks collect metrics but don't push them to OTLP
## Root Cause
The `timed_hook_execution` context manager at line 293-357:
1. ✓ Collects metrics via `metrics.increment()` and `metrics.observe()`
2. ✗ Does NOT call `export_metrics_if_configured()` to push to OTLP

Only `stop_handler.py` pushes metrics. Other hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse) collect but never export.

## Impact
- Hook metrics exist in Prometheus label index (from historical pushes)
- Current hook executions produce no data points
- Dashboard shows empty panels

- src/git_notes_memory/hooks/hook_utils.py:334-357 (missing export call)
