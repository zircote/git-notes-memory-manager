## Summary
User confirmed scope: Pattern + Entropy detection, PII included, full audit logging, CLI + config allowlist, redact file content.

- **PII**: Include SSN, credit cards, phone numbers
- **Audit**: Full audit trail for compliance
- **Allowlist**: CLI commands + config file
- **Files**: Redact content (don't skip files)
- **Scanning**: Yes, with full remediation capability
- **Dependencies**: Pure Python only
