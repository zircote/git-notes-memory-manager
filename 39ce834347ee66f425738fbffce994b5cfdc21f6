Memory index location is project-specific at .memory/index.db
## Context
Investigated why index showed 0 memories after sync reported 2692.

## Key Insight
The SyncService uses `get_project_index_path(repo_path)` which resolves to `.memory/index.db`, NOT `.git/memory-index.db` or the global `~/.local/share/memory-plugin/index.db`.
