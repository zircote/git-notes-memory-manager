Created GitHub issue #31 for PLUGIN_ROOT path resolution bug
## Summary
Investigated and filed comprehensive bug report for path resolution failures in marketplace-installed plugins. The issue affects 12+ command files and includes three solution options with recommendation.

## Changes Made
- Investigated 12+ affected command files
- Traced root cause to hardcoded namespace assumption
- Discovered secondary issue (missing scripts/ in distribution)
- Generated detailed issue report with file:line references
- Filed issue #31 to zircote/git-notes-memory

Skipped committing broken metrics.py script
## Summary
Reviewed pending changes and found only one untracked file (`.claude-plugin/scripts/metrics.py`) which uses a non-existent API (`get_metrics_registry`). Per user decision, skipped committing this broken file.

## Context
- The broken script is related to issue #31 filed earlier
- Issue #31 recommends using Python module imports instead of scripts
- The actual API is `get_metrics()` not `get_metrics_registry()`

Deep-clean code review and remediation complete - all findings resolved
## Summary
Completed comprehensive `/claude-spec:deep-clean --focus MAXALL` with 9 parallel specialist agents (Security, Performance, Test Coverage, Database, Code Quality, Documentation, Architecture, Resilience, Compliance). All critical and high-priority findings remediated, full verification passing.

## Changes Made
- **CRIT-001**: Fixed SQLite connection leak in `index.py` - added proper cleanup with `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` on initialization failure
- **MED-001**: Fixed session hook connection cleanup in `session_start_handler.py` - added `try/finally` block
- **LOW-004**: Added composite index for `status+timestamp` queries in `index.py`
- **LOW-010**: Added warning logging for batch note fetch fallback in `git_ops.py`
- **HIGH-006**: Created comprehensive `docs/ENV.md` with all environment variables documented
- **HIGH-007**: Added CHANGELOG v0.12.0 entry with observability and secrets filtering features
- **Test Fix**: Fixed `domain=domain.value` parameter in Memory creation in `capture.py`
- **Lint Fix**: Moved logger initialization after imports in `git_ops.py`

## Verification Results
- **Tests**: 2,342 passed (100%)
- **Coverage**: 88.21% (exceeds 80% requirement)
- **Formatting**: PASS
- **Linting**: PASS (ruff)
- **Type checking**: PASS (mypy strict)
- **Security**: PASS (bandit)

Skipped committing broken metrics.py script
## Summary
Reviewed pending changes and found only one untracked file (`.claude-plugin/scripts/metrics.py`) which uses a non-existent API (`get_metrics_registry`). Per user decision, skipped committing this broken file.

## Context
- The broken script is related to issue #31 filed earlier
- Issue #31 recommends using Python module imports instead of scripts
- The actual API is `get_metrics()` not `get_metrics_registry()`

Deep-clean code review and remediation complete - all findings resolved
## Summary
Completed comprehensive `/claude-spec:deep-clean --focus MAXALL` with 9 parallel specialist agents (Security, Performance, Test Coverage, Database, Code Quality, Documentation, Architecture, Resilience, Compliance). All critical and high-priority findings remediated, full verification passing.

## Changes Made
- **CRIT-001**: Fixed SQLite connection leak in `index.py` - added proper cleanup with `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` on initialization failure
- **MED-001**: Fixed session hook connection cleanup in `session_start_handler.py` - added `try/finally` block
- **LOW-004**: Added composite index for `status+timestamp` queries in `index.py`
- **LOW-010**: Added warning logging for batch note fetch fallback in `git_ops.py`
- **HIGH-006**: Created comprehensive `docs/ENV.md` with all environment variables documented
- **HIGH-007**: Added CHANGELOG v0.12.0 entry with observability and secrets filtering features
- **Test Fix**: Fixed `domain=domain.value` parameter in Memory creation in `capture.py`
- **Lint Fix**: Moved logger initialization after imports in `git_ops.py`

## Verification Results
- **Tests**: 2,342 passed (100%)
- **Coverage**: 88.21% (exceeds 80% requirement)
- **Formatting**: PASS
- **Linting**: PASS (ruff)
- **Type checking**: PASS (mypy strict)
- **Security**: PASS (bandit)
