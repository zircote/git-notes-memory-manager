Skipped committing broken metrics.py script
## Summary
Reviewed pending changes and found only one untracked file (`.claude-plugin/scripts/metrics.py`) which uses a non-existent API (`get_metrics_registry`). Per user decision, skipped committing this broken file.

## Context
- The broken script is related to issue #31 filed earlier
- Issue #31 recommends using Python module imports instead of scripts
- The actual API is `get_metrics()` not `get_metrics_registry()`
