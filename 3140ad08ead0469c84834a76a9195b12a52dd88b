CognitiveSubstrate research provides comprehensive theoretical foundation
## Summary
The existing research documents provide deep theoretical grounding and industry context that must inform the specification.

## Key Insights
1. **Dual-Process Theory (Kahneman)**: System 1 (fast recall) vs System 2 (deliberate verification) maps directly to the architecture
2. **Cognitive Architectures (SOAR, ACT-R)**: Base-Level Activation (BLA) concept from ACT-R informs decay/reinforcement scoring
3. **MemGPT/Letta**: Explicitly supports "conscious" and "subconscious" threads - validates the pattern
4. **Adversarial Robustness**: Research shows current RAG defenses are inadequate - security is differentiating
5. **A-MEM (Zettelkasten)**: Dynamic indexing and memory evolution outperforms MemGPT on multi-hop reasoning
