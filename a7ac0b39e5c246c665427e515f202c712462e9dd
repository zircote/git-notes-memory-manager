Rebased issue-11-subconsciousness branch onto v1.0.0
## Summary
Successfully rebased the subconsciousness feature branch onto the v1.0.0 release, resolving 6 merge conflicts and ensuring all quality checks pass.

## Changes Made
- **pyproject.toml**: Merged mypy overrides for both `detect_secrets.*` (v1.0.0) and `anthropic/openai/httpx` (feature branch)
- **capture.py**: Kept v1.0.0's robust PID-based stale lock detection with `_is_process_alive()`, `_read_lock_pid()`, `_write_lock_pid()` helpers
- **hook_utils.py**: Merged `__all__` exports to include both `timed_hook_execution` and `scrub_pii`
- **session_start_handler.py**: Combined best of both approaches - context manager for cleanup with specific exception types
- **index.py**: Merged comprehensive composite indexes from v1.0.0 plus `idx_memories_ns_spec_ts` from feature branch
- **uv.lock**: Regenerated with all dependencies
