Completed code review comment processing for PR #26
## Summary
Processed 24 Copilot review comments on PR #26 for the subconsciousness layer feature. Assessed validity, provided responses, remediated valid findings, and resolved all threads.

## Assessment Results
- **5 `last_error not used` findings**: FALSE POSITIVES - variable IS used at loop end for fallback error
- **17 `__all__` export findings**: FALSE POSITIVES - `__getattr__` lazy import pattern is intentional
- **1 exception pass block**: VALID - added explanatory comment and explicit assignment
- **2 command injection vulnerabilities**: CRITICAL/VALID - fixed by passing ID via environment variable

## Changes Made
- `implicit_capture_agent.py:285-290`: Added comment explaining silent exception handling
- `commands/review.md:175-185,234-243`: Fixed shell injection by using `MEMORY_CAPTURE_ID` env var

## Actions Taken
- Posted 24 response comments explaining decisions
- Resolved all 24 review threads via GraphQL API
- Committed and pushed fixes
