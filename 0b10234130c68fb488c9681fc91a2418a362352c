Confirmed key architectural decisions for multi-domain memories
## Summary
User validated 4 critical design decisions from the open questions in GitHub Issue #13.

## Rationale
- **Storage**: Separate bare git repo at `~/.local/share/memory-plugin/user-memories/` - maintains git notes semantics for both domains
- **Conflicts**: Project memories override user memories - local context is more specific
- **Team domain**: Deferred to v2 - keep initial scope focused
- **Sync**: Optional remote auto-sync - configure remote and sync on session events
