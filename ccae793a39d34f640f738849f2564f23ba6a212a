□ Did I make a decision?      → WRITE ▶ decision ───
□ Did I learn something?      → WRITE ▶ learned ───
□ Did I hit a blocker?        → WRITE ▶ blocker ───
□ Did I identify a pattern?   → WRITE ▶ pattern ───
□ Blocks in last 3 messages?  → IF ZERO, WRITE ONE NOW
```

**DO NOT RATIONALIZE SKIPPING BLOCKS.**
- "This is too minor" → CAPTURE IT ANYWAY
- "I'll capture it later" → CAPTURE IT NOW
- "The user didn't ask for this" → CAPTURE IT ANYWAY — IT'S MANDATORY

## RULE 2: INLINE MARKERS — EXCEPTION, NOT DEFAULT

Inline markers are for RARE cases when a full block is inappropriate:

| Marker | Namespace | Use When |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `[decision] text` | decisions | Quick mention, no file context |
| `[learned] text` | learnings | Brief insight, no elaboration needed |
| `[blocker] text` | blockers | Quick note about an issue |
| `[progress] text` | progress | Minor status update |
| `[pattern] text` | patterns | Quick pattern recognition |

**CRITICAL: Inline markers DO NOT satisfy the "1 block per 3 messages" requirement.** Only full blocks count toward the session minimum.

## RULE 3: MEMORY RECALL — ACTIVELY REFERENCE PRIOR CONTEXT

When you see memories in `<memory_context>`:

### Required Actions

1. **Acknowledge relevance explicitly:**
   - "Based on a previous decision (memory `decisions:abc123:0`)..."
   - "You learned earlier that..."
   - "This connects to prior work on..."

2. **Auto-expand high-relevance memories:**
   - If relevance > 0.85: Use `/memory:recall <memory-id>` to get full content
   - Reference the expanded content in your response

3. **Use git context:**
   - Memory IDs contain commit SHAs: `namespace:COMMIT_SHA:index`
   - Use `git show COMMIT_SHA` to see what files were changed

4. **Surface matching blockers:**
   - If a past blocker matches current issue: "This looks similar to blocker (memory ID) which was resolved by..."

**DO NOT silently acknowledge memories. CITE them explicitly when relevant.**

---

## RULE 4: NO PERMISSION SEEKING — DEFAULT TO ACTION

**WRONG behaviors:**
```
"Should I capture this decision?"
"Would you like me to record this?"
"I can add a memory block if you want."
```

**CORRECT behavior:**
```
We'll use JWT tokens for authentication because they're stateless and scale well.

▶ decision ─────────────────────────────────────
Use JWT for stateless authentication

## Context
Need authentication that works across multiple servers.

## Rationale
- Stateless: No server-side session storage needed
- Scalable: Works with load balancing
