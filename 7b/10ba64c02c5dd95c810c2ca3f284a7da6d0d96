Skipped committing broken metrics.py script
## Summary
Reviewed pending changes and found only one untracked file (`.claude-plugin/scripts/metrics.py`) which uses a non-existent API (`get_metrics_registry`). Per user decision, skipped committing this broken file.

## Context
- The broken script is related to issue #31 filed earlier
- Issue #31 recommends using Python module imports instead of scripts
- The actual API is `get_metrics()` not `get_metrics_registry()`

- **LOW-010**: Added warning logging for batch note fetch fallback in `git_ops.py`
- **HIGH-006**: Created comprehensive `docs/ENV.md` with all environment variables documented
- **HIGH-007**: Added CHANGELOG v0.12.0 entry with observability and secrets filtering features
- **Test Fix**: Fixed `domain=domain.value` parameter in Memory creation in `capture.py`
- **Lint Fix**: Moved logger initialization after imports in `git_ops.py`

## Verification Results
- **Tests**: 2,342 passed (100%)
- **Coverage**: 88.21% (exceeds 80% requirement)
- **Formatting**: PASS
- **Linting**: PASS (ruff)
- **Type checking**: PASS (mypy strict)
- **Security**: PASS (bandit)
