Prioritizing remediation based on impact vs effort
## Context
Original findings: 4 CRIT, 23 HIGH (3 SEC, 5 PERF, 8 ARCH, 7 TEST), 42 MED, 28 LOW

## Rationale
1. **CRIT/SEC/PERF-HIGH: DONE** - Highest impact security and performance fixes
2. **ARCH-HIGH: Defer** - Refactoring (IndexService 37 methods, 5 DI patterns) - large effort, low urgency
3. **TEST-HIGH: Partially addressed** - Handler tests exist, provider tests need mocking external APIs
4. **MEDIUM findings: Sample fixes** - Selective based on impact

## Related Files
- All security/performance fixes completed and tested
