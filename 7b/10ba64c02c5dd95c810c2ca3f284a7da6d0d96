Skipped committing broken metrics.py script
## Summary
Reviewed pending changes and found only one untracked file (`.claude-plugin/scripts/metrics.py`) which uses a non-existent API (`get_metrics_registry`). Per user decision, skipped committing this broken file.

## Context
- The broken script is related to issue #31 filed earlier
- Issue #31 recommends using Python module imports instead of scripts
- The actual API is `get_metrics()` not `get_metrics_registry()`

Added proactive memory search guidance to SessionStart templates
## Summary
Updated all three guidance templates (minimal, standard, detailed) with RULE 5 encouraging Claude to search for relevant memories BEFORE modifying code, rather than relying solely on the ~5 generic memories injected at session start.

## Changes Made
- Added RULE 5: PROACTIVE MEMORY SEARCH to `guidance_standard.md` with when/how to search
- Added expanded RULE 5 to `guidance_detailed.md` with tables and code examples
- Added brief proactive search note to `guidance_minimal.md`
- Added failure mode warning for skipping proactive search in all templates
- Updated self-audit reminders to include proactive search check
- Updated test thresholds: standard 1500→1700 tokens, detailed 2500→2800 tokens

## Context
SessionStart uses a generic project name query that yields low relevance (~0.53). Task-specific queries yield much better results (~0.77+). This guidance encourages Claude to search for memories related to specific components/files before modifying them.

Local plugin installation verified and metrics command executed
## Summary
Successfully installed memory-capture plugin from local git-notes-memory marketplace. The plugin cache structure was resolved with `source: "./../"` workaround for the schema requirement.

## Changes Made
- Fixed marketplace.json source path: `"./"` → `"./../"` (schema requires `./` prefix but needs parent traversal)
- Verified plugin installation from local marketplace
- Metrics command works but shows empty collectors (expected for fresh session)

- lint-check-on-edit: use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`

Completed CRIT-001: Added circuit breaker to embedding service
## Summary
Implemented circuit breaker pattern in EmbeddingService to prevent repeated calls to failing embedding model.

## Changes Made
- Added `CircuitState` enum (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN)
- Added `CircuitOpenError` exception class
- Added `EmbeddingCircuitBreaker` dataclass with thread-safe state management
- Updated `embed()` method with circuit breaker checks and success/failure recording
- Updated `embed_batch()` method with same circuit breaker logic
- Added 14 new tests covering all circuit breaker functionality

Completed CRIT-002: Integrated secrets filtering for LLM prompts
## Summary
Added secrets filtering to LLMClient to prevent PII from being sent to external LLM providers, addressing GDPR Art. 44-49 compliance.

## Changes Made
- Added `filter_secrets` parameter to LLMClient (default: True)
- Added `_secrets_service` field initialized in `__post_init__`
- Added `_filter_request_secrets()` method to filter all messages
- Integrated filtering in `complete_request()` before sending to provider
- Created 10 new tests for secrets filtering functionality

Completed CRIT-003: Moved user capture service to ServiceRegistry
## Summary
Replaced module-level `_user_capture_service` global with ServiceRegistry-based singleton management. Added `ServiceRegistry.has()` method for checking existence without auto-creating.

## Changes Made
- Created `UserCaptureService` subclass of `CaptureService` for distinct registry type
- Rewrote `get_user_capture_service()` to use `ServiceRegistry.has()` + `register()` pattern
- Added `ServiceRegistry.has()` method for non-auto-creating existence check
- Updated 4 tests to remove obsolete `_user_capture_service = None` reset

Completed all 4 CRITICAL severity findings from code review
## Summary
All 4 CRITICAL findings have been remediated:
- CRIT-001: Circuit breaker added to embedding service (resilience)
- CRIT-002: Secrets filtering integrated for LLM prompts (GDPR compliance)
- CRIT-003: User capture service moved to ServiceRegistry (thread safety)
- CRIT-004: Adversarial screening activated (prompt injection defense)

## Changes Made
- `src/git_notes_memory/embedding.py`: Added circuit breaker to `embed_batch()`, fixed type handling
- `src/git_notes_memory/subconsciousness/llm_client.py`: Integrated `SecretsFilteringService` before API calls
- `src/git_notes_memory/capture.py`: Created `UserCaptureService` wrapper, rewrote `get_user_capture_service()` to use ServiceRegistry
- `src/git_notes_memory/registry.py`: Added `has()` method for existence checking
- `src/git_notes_memory/subconsciousness/implicit_capture_agent.py`: Added `_screen_memories()` method and `adversarial_detector` field

## Test Coverage
- 14 new tests for circuit breaker (`tests/test_embedding.py`)
- 10 new tests for LLM secrets filtering (`tests/subconsciousness/test_llm_secrets_filtering.py`)
- 4 updated tests for user capture service (`tests/test_capture.py`)
- 7 new tests for adversarial screening (`tests/subconsciousness/test_implicit_capture_agent.py`)

## Verification
- 472 affected tests pass
- All lint checks pass
- All type checks pass (mypy strict)
