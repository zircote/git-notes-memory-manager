User confirmed full 3-tier implementation with optional extras pattern
## Summary
All three observability tiers will be implemented, with OpenTelemetry as an optional `[monitoring]` extra.

## Rationale
- Full implementation provides complete observability stack
- Optional extras pattern (`pip install .[monitoring]`) keeps core lightweight
- Structured JSON logging becomes new default
- Unified debug levels replace fragmented HOOK_DEBUG

Finalized v1 scope and design decisions
## Context
User approved the observability instrumentation specification after review. All planning artifacts are complete and ready for implementation.

## Decision
Approved SPEC-2025-12-25-001 (Observability Instrumentation and Distributed Tracing) for implementation with the following scope:
- 6 phases, 29 tasks covering Tier 1-3 observability features
- Core infrastructure with optional extras pattern
- Docker Compose local stack for development
- Multi-provider documentation (7 platforms)
- Session identification for multi-tenant telemetry

## Rationale
The specification is comprehensive with:
- Complete requirements covering all user needs (GitHub Issue #10)
- Detailed technical architecture with 7 components
- Well-defined implementation plan with clear acceptance criteria
- 11 ADRs documenting all major design decisions
- Risk mitigation strategies for all identified concerns
