Fixed Grafana dashboard template variable UIDs
## Summary
The dashboard broke because template variables had `current.value` set to datasource names ("Prometheus", "Tempo", "Loki") instead of UIDs ("prometheus", "tempo", "loki"). This mismatch occurred after adding explicit UIDs to datasources.yaml.

## Changes Made
- Updated `docker/grafana/dashboards/subconsciousness.json`:
  - Line 1675: Changed `"value": "Prometheus"` to `"value": "prometheus"`
  - Line 1690: Changed `"value": "Tempo"` to `"value": "tempo"`
  - Line 1705: Changed `"value": "Loki"` to `"value": "loki"`

## Verification
- Dashboard loads: Git Notes Memory - Subconsciousness
- Template variables resolve to correct UIDs
- Prometheus queries execute successfully
- No "Data source not found" errors after restart

Fixed $HOME directory creation bug - paths now expand shell variables
## Summary
The code was creating literal `$HOME/` directories instead of expanding the shell variable because Python's `Path.expanduser()` only expands `~`, not `$HOME`.

## Changes Made
- **src/git_notes_memory/config.py:261-264**: Added `os.path.expandvars()` to expand `$HOME` before `expanduser()` in `get_data_path()`
- **src/git_notes_memory/observability/config.py:213-214**: Added `os.path.expandvars()` when parsing values from the env file

## Root Cause
Your `~/.local/share/memory-plugin/env` has:
```
export MEMORY_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/memory-plugin"
```

The code was using only `.expanduser()` which expands `~` but NOT `$HOME`. When the path wasn't expanded, the embedding model (xet) created directories relative to cwd, resulting in literal `$HOME/` folders.

Added make sync-plugin target for live plugin development
## Summary
Created a Makefile target that syncs source files to the plugin cache directory, enabling rapid iteration during plugin development without needing to reinstall.

## Changes Made
- Added `sync-plugin` to `.PHONY` targets
- Added "Plugin Development" section to help output
- Added `sync-plugin` target that:
  - Auto-detects installed version from cache directory
  - Uses rsync with appropriate excludes (`.venv`, `__pycache__`, etc.)
  - Provides clear feedback on sync status

Fixed Grafana dashboard template variable UIDs
## Summary
The dashboard broke because template variables had `current.value` set to datasource names ("Prometheus", "Tempo", "Loki") instead of UIDs ("prometheus", "tempo", "loki"). This mismatch occurred after adding explicit UIDs to datasources.yaml.

## Changes Made
- Updated `docker/grafana/dashboards/subconsciousness.json`:
  - Line 1675: Changed `"value": "Prometheus"` to `"value": "prometheus"`
  - Line 1690: Changed `"value": "Tempo"` to `"value": "tempo"`
  - Line 1705: Changed `"value": "Loki"` to `"value": "loki"`

## Verification
- Dashboard loads: Git Notes Memory - Subconsciousness
- Template variables resolve to correct UIDs
- Prometheus queries execute successfully
- No "Data source not found" errors after restart

Fixed $HOME directory creation bug - paths now expand shell variables
## Summary
The code was creating literal `$HOME/` directories instead of expanding the shell variable because Python's `Path.expanduser()` only expands `~`, not `$HOME`.

## Changes Made
- **src/git_notes_memory/config.py:261-264**: Added `os.path.expandvars()` to expand `$HOME` before `expanduser()` in `get_data_path()`
- **src/git_notes_memory/observability/config.py:213-214**: Added `os.path.expandvars()` when parsing values from the env file

## Root Cause
Your `~/.local/share/memory-plugin/env` has:
```
export MEMORY_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/memory-plugin"
```

The code was using only `.expanduser()` which expands `~` but NOT `$HOME`. When the path wasn't expanded, the embedding model (xet) created directories relative to cwd, resulting in literal `$HOME/` folders.

Fixed subconsciousness OpenAI provider and parser bugs
## Summary
Fixed multiple bugs preventing the LLM subconsciousness from working with OpenAI.

## Changes Made

Fixed Grafana dashboard template variable UIDs
## Summary
The dashboard broke because template variables had `current.value` set to datasource names ("Prometheus", "Tempo", "Loki") instead of UIDs ("prometheus", "tempo", "loki"). This mismatch occurred after adding explicit UIDs to datasources.yaml.

## Changes Made
- Updated `docker/grafana/dashboards/subconsciousness.json`:
  - Line 1675: Changed `"value": "Prometheus"` to `"value": "prometheus"`
  - Line 1690: Changed `"value": "Tempo"` to `"value": "tempo"`
  - Line 1705: Changed `"value": "Loki"` to `"value": "loki"`

## Verification
- Dashboard loads: Git Notes Memory - Subconsciousness
- Template variables resolve to correct UIDs
- Prometheus queries execute successfully
- No "Data source not found" errors after restart

Fixed $HOME directory creation bug - paths now expand shell variables
## Summary
The code was creating literal `$HOME/` directories instead of expanding the shell variable because Python's `Path.expanduser()` only expands `~`, not `$HOME`.

## Changes Made
- **src/git_notes_memory/config.py:261-264**: Added `os.path.expandvars()` to expand `$HOME` before `expanduser()` in `get_data_path()`
- **src/git_notes_memory/observability/config.py:213-214**: Added `os.path.expandvars()` when parsing values from the env file

## Root Cause
Your `~/.local/share/memory-plugin/env` has:
```
export MEMORY_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/memory-plugin"
```

The code was using only `.expanduser()` which expands `~` but NOT `$HOME`. When the path wasn't expanded, the embedding model (xet) created directories relative to cwd, resulting in literal `$HOME/` folders.

## Summary
Migrated research documents from `docs/research/CognitiveSubstrate/` into formal spec structure at `docs/spec/active/2025-12-27-memory-consolidation/`.

## Deliverables Created
- **REQUIREMENTS.md**: 11 functional requirements, 6 non-functional requirements including deep observability
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Component architecture, data flow, observability instrumentation by module, trace hierarchy
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: 220 tasks across 7 phases with no deferrals
- **README.md**: Project summary and metadata

## Key Design Points
- Deep observability at every level (not just hooks)
- 220 implementation tasks - no skipping, no deferring
- Feature-gated via pip extras `[consolidation]`
- Idempotent SessionStart summary injection

Fixed $HOME directory creation bug - paths now expand shell variables
## Summary
The code was creating literal `$HOME/` directories instead of expanding the shell variable because Python's `Path.expanduser()` only expands `~`, not `$HOME`.

## Changes Made
- **src/git_notes_memory/config.py:261-264**: Added `os.path.expandvars()` to expand `$HOME` before `expanduser()` in `get_data_path()`
- **src/git_notes_memory/observability/config.py:213-214**: Added `os.path.expandvars()` when parsing values from the env file

## Root Cause
Your `~/.local/share/memory-plugin/env` has:
```
export MEMORY_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/memory-plugin"
```

The code was using only `.expanduser()` which expands `~` but NOT `$HOME`. When the path wasn't expanded, the embedding model (xet) created directories relative to cwd, resulting in literal `$HOME/` folders.

Enhanced Grafana dashboard and subconsciousness prompts with all namespaces
## Summary
Completed comprehensive observability dashboard and fixed namespace coverage for LLM memory extraction.

## Changes Made

### 1. Grafana Dashboard (`docker/grafana/dashboards/subconsciousness.json`)
Enhanced from metrics-only to full observability with all three pillars:

**Metrics (Prometheus):**
- LLM Overview: Requests, Errors, Memories, Tokens, Cost, Rate Limits
- LLM Performance: Latency, Token Usage, Cost by Model, Errors by Type
- Agent Performance: Analysis Duration, Confidence, Chunks vs Memories
- Provider & Circuit Breaker: Requests by Provider, Circuit Events, Fallbacks
- Capture Service: Memory Disposition, Duration, Approved by Namespace
- Adversarial Detection: Blocked count, Detections by Level

**Tracing (Tempo):**
- Subconsciousness Traces search panel
- LLM Provider Traces with TraceQL queries
- Agent & Service Traces
- LLM Request Duration Distribution
- Error Traces panel

**Logging (Loki):**
- Subconsciousness Logs stream
- LLM Provider Logs
- Agent & Capture Logs
- Error Log Count stat
- Warning Log Count stat
- Log Volume by Level timeseries
- Error & Exception Logs panel
- Logs with Trace Context (correlated)
- Logs by Session for debugging
- RED Metrics and Health Ratios

### 2. Subconsciousness Prompts (`src/git_notes_memory/subconsciousness/prompts.py`)
Updated from 5 namespaces to all 10:

| Namespace | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `inception` | Project initialization and setup |
| `elicitation` | Requirements gathering and user needs |
| `research` | Investigation findings and background |
| `decisions` | Architecture and design choices |
| `progress` | Milestones and task completions |
| `blockers` | Problems that blocked progress |
| `reviews` | Code review feedback and assessments |
| `learnings` | New understanding and insights |
| `retrospective` | Reflection on what worked/didn't |
| `patterns` | Reusable approaches and solutions |

### 3. Test Updates (`tests/subconsciousness/test_prompts.py`)
Updated namespace enum test to match new 10-namespace list.

Fixed Grafana dashboard template variable UIDs
## Summary
The dashboard broke because template variables had `current.value` set to datasource names ("Prometheus", "Tempo", "Loki") instead of UIDs ("prometheus", "tempo", "loki"). This mismatch occurred after adding explicit UIDs to datasources.yaml.

## Changes Made
- Updated `docker/grafana/dashboards/subconsciousness.json`:
  - Line 1675: Changed `"value": "Prometheus"` to `"value": "prometheus"`
  - Line 1690: Changed `"value": "Tempo"` to `"value": "tempo"`
  - Line 1705: Changed `"value": "Loki"` to `"value": "loki"`

## Verification
- Dashboard loads: Git Notes Memory - Subconsciousness
- Template variables resolve to correct UIDs
- Prometheus queries execute successfully
- No "Data source not found" errors after restart

Fixed subconsciousness OpenAI provider and parser bugs
## Summary
Fixed multiple bugs preventing the LLM subconsciousness from working with OpenAI.

## Changes Made
- Fixed OpenAI provider to use `max_completion_tokens` for o1/o3/gpt-5 models
- Fixed OpenAI provider to skip `temperature` param for reasoning models
- Fixed agent parser to accept `type`/`details` fields from LLM response (not just `namespace`/`content`)

Enhanced Grafana dashboard and subconsciousness prompts with all namespaces
## Summary
Completed comprehensive observability dashboard and fixed namespace coverage for LLM memory extraction.

## Changes Made

### 1. Grafana Dashboard (`docker/grafana/dashboards/subconsciousness.json`)
Enhanced from metrics-only to full observability with all three pillars:

**Metrics (Prometheus):**
- LLM Overview: Requests, Errors, Memories, Tokens, Cost, Rate Limits
- LLM Performance: Latency, Token Usage, Cost by Model, Errors by Type
- Agent Performance: Analysis Duration, Confidence, Chunks vs Memories
- Provider & Circuit Breaker: Requests by Provider, Circuit Events, Fallbacks
- Capture Service: Memory Disposition, Duration, Approved by Namespace
- Adversarial Detection: Blocked count, Detections by Level

**Tracing (Tempo):**
- Subconsciousness Traces search panel
- LLM Provider Traces with TraceQL queries
- Agent & Service Traces
- LLM Request Duration Distribution
- Error Traces panel

**Logging (Loki):**
- Subconsciousness Logs stream
- LLM Provider Logs
- Agent & Capture Logs
- Error Log Count stat
- Warning Log Count stat
- Log Volume by Level timeseries
- Error & Exception Logs panel
- Logs with Trace Context (correlated)
- Logs by Session for debugging
- RED Metrics and Health Ratios

### 2. Subconsciousness Prompts (`src/git_notes_memory/subconsciousness/prompts.py`)
Updated from 5 namespaces to all 10:

| Namespace | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `inception` | Project initialization and setup |
| `elicitation` | Requirements gathering and user needs |
| `research` | Investigation findings and background |
| `decisions` | Architecture and design choices |
| `progress` | Milestones and task completions |
| `blockers` | Problems that blocked progress |
| `reviews` | Code review feedback and assessments |
| `learnings` | New understanding and insights |
| `retrospective` | Reflection on what worked/didn't |
| `patterns` | Reusable approaches and solutions |

### 3. Test Updates (`tests/subconsciousness/test_prompts.py`)
Updated namespace enum test to match new 10-namespace list.

Fixed Grafana dashboard template variable UIDs
## Summary
The dashboard broke because template variables had `current.value` set to datasource names ("Prometheus", "Tempo", "Loki") instead of UIDs ("prometheus", "tempo", "loki"). This mismatch occurred after adding explicit UIDs to datasources.yaml.

## Changes Made
- Updated `docker/grafana/dashboards/subconsciousness.json`:
  - Line 1675: Changed `"value": "Prometheus"` to `"value": "prometheus"`
  - Line 1690: Changed `"value": "Tempo"` to `"value": "tempo"`
  - Line 1705: Changed `"value": "Loki"` to `"value": "loki"`

## Verification
- Dashboard loads: Git Notes Memory - Subconsciousness
- Template variables resolve to correct UIDs
- Prometheus queries execute successfully
- No "Data source not found" errors after restart

Fixed $HOME directory creation bug - paths now expand shell variables
## Summary
The code was creating literal `$HOME/` directories instead of expanding the shell variable because Python's `Path.expanduser()` only expands `~`, not `$HOME`.

## Changes Made
- **src/git_notes_memory/config.py:261-264**: Added `os.path.expandvars()` to expand `$HOME` before `expanduser()` in `get_data_path()`
- **src/git_notes_memory/observability/config.py:213-214**: Added `os.path.expandvars()` when parsing values from the env file

## Root Cause
Your `~/.local/share/memory-plugin/env` has:
```
export MEMORY_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/memory-plugin"
```

The code was using only `.expanduser()` which expands `~` but NOT `$HOME`. When the path wasn't expanded, the embedding model (xet) created directories relative to cwd, resulting in literal `$HOME/` folders.

Added make sync-plugin target for live plugin development
## Summary
Created a Makefile target that syncs source files to the plugin cache directory, enabling rapid iteration during plugin development without needing to reinstall.

## Changes Made
- Added `sync-plugin` to `.PHONY` targets
- Added "Plugin Development" section to help output
- Added `sync-plugin` target that:
  - Auto-detects installed version from cache directory
  - Uses rsync with appropriate excludes (`.venv`, `__pycache__`, etc.)
  - Provides clear feedback on sync status

Created formal spec project for Memory Consolidation from research documents
## Summary
Migrated research documents from `docs/research/CognitiveSubstrate/` into formal spec structure at `docs/spec/active/2025-12-27-memory-consolidation/`.

## Deliverables Created
- **REQUIREMENTS.md**: 11 functional requirements, 6 non-functional requirements including deep observability
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Component architecture, data flow, observability instrumentation by module, trace hierarchy
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: 220 tasks across 7 phases with no deferrals
- **README.md**: Project summary and metadata

## Key Design Points
- Deep observability at every level (not just hooks)
- 220 implementation tasks - no skipping, no deferring
- Feature-gated via pip extras `[consolidation]`
- Idempotent SessionStart summary injection

Fixed Grafana dashboard template variable UIDs
## Summary
The dashboard broke because template variables had `current.value` set to datasource names ("Prometheus", "Tempo", "Loki") instead of UIDs ("prometheus", "tempo", "loki"). This mismatch occurred after adding explicit UIDs to datasources.yaml.

## Changes Made
- Updated `docker/grafana/dashboards/subconsciousness.json`:
  - Line 1675: Changed `"value": "Prometheus"` to `"value": "prometheus"`
  - Line 1690: Changed `"value": "Tempo"` to `"value": "tempo"`
  - Line 1705: Changed `"value": "Loki"` to `"value": "loki"`

## Verification
- Dashboard loads: Git Notes Memory - Subconsciousness
- Template variables resolve to correct UIDs
- Prometheus queries execute successfully
- No "Data source not found" errors after restart

Fixed $HOME directory creation bug - paths now expand shell variables
## Summary
The code was creating literal `$HOME/` directories instead of expanding the shell variable because Python's `Path.expanduser()` only expands `~`, not `$HOME`.

## Changes Made
- **src/git_notes_memory/config.py:261-264**: Added `os.path.expandvars()` to expand `$HOME` before `expanduser()` in `get_data_path()`
- **src/git_notes_memory/observability/config.py:213-214**: Added `os.path.expandvars()` when parsing values from the env file

## Root Cause
Your `~/.local/share/memory-plugin/env` has:
```
export MEMORY_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/memory-plugin"
```

The code was using only `.expanduser()` which expands `~` but NOT `$HOME`. When the path wasn't expanded, the embedding model (xet) created directories relative to cwd, resulting in literal `$HOME/` folders.

Added make sync-plugin target for live plugin development
## Summary
Created a Makefile target that syncs source files to the plugin cache directory, enabling rapid iteration during plugin development without needing to reinstall.

## Changes Made
- Added `sync-plugin` to `.PHONY` targets
- Added "Plugin Development" section to help output
- Added `sync-plugin` target that:
  - Auto-detects installed version from cache directory
  - Uses rsync with appropriate excludes (`.venv`, `__pycache__`, etc.)
  - Provides clear feedback on sync status

Created formal spec project for Memory Consolidation from research documents
## Summary
Migrated research documents from `docs/research/CognitiveSubstrate/` into formal spec structure at `docs/spec/active/2025-12-27-memory-consolidation/`.

## Deliverables Created
- **REQUIREMENTS.md**: 11 functional requirements, 6 non-functional requirements including deep observability
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Component architecture, data flow, observability instrumentation by module, trace hierarchy
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: 220 tasks across 7 phases with no deferrals
- **README.md**: Project summary and metadata

## Key Design Points
- Deep observability at every level (not just hooks)
- 220 implementation tasks - no skipping, no deferring
- Feature-gated via pip extras `[consolidation]`
- Idempotent SessionStart summary injection

Fixed Grafana dashboard template variable UIDs
## Summary
The dashboard broke because template variables had `current.value` set to datasource names ("Prometheus", "Tempo", "Loki") instead of UIDs ("prometheus", "tempo", "loki"). This mismatch occurred after adding explicit UIDs to datasources.yaml.

## Changes Made
- Updated `docker/grafana/dashboards/subconsciousness.json`:
  - Line 1675: Changed `"value": "Prometheus"` to `"value": "prometheus"`
  - Line 1690: Changed `"value": "Tempo"` to `"value": "tempo"`
  - Line 1705: Changed `"value": "Loki"` to `"value": "loki"`

## Verification
- Dashboard loads: Git Notes Memory - Subconsciousness
- Template variables resolve to correct UIDs
- Prometheus queries execute successfully
- No "Data source not found" errors after restart

Created unified Observability Overview dashboard
## Summary
Created a single-pane-of-glass dashboard that brings together all observability pillars in one place.

## Dashboard Layout

**Row 1: System Health** (6 stat panels)
- Service status (Memory Plugin, Prometheus)
- Error rate, Latency p95, Operations count
- Error count from logs

**Row 2: Key Metrics** (5 panels)
- Operations rate by type (capture/recall/search)
- Operation latency (p50/p95)
- Hook executions and latency
- Memory distribution by namespace (pie)

**Row 3: Distributed Traces**
- Recent traces from Tempo with service filter

**Row 4: Logs**
- Error logs (filtered)
- All logs (structured JSON formatted)

**Row 5: LLM / Subconsciousness**
- LLM requests, errors, latency
- Memories extracted, pending approval, avg confidence
- LLM requests by provider, extractions by namespace

Fixed $HOME directory creation bug - paths now expand shell variables
## Summary
The code was creating literal `$HOME/` directories instead of expanding the shell variable because Python's `Path.expanduser()` only expands `~`, not `$HOME`.

## Changes Made
- **src/git_notes_memory/config.py:261-264**: Added `os.path.expandvars()` to expand `$HOME` before `expanduser()` in `get_data_path()`
- **src/git_notes_memory/observability/config.py:213-214**: Added `os.path.expandvars()` when parsing values from the env file

## Root Cause
Your `~/.local/share/memory-plugin/env` has:
```
export MEMORY_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/memory-plugin"
```

The code was using only `.expanduser()` which expands `~` but NOT `$HOME`. When the path wasn't expanded, the embedding model (xet) created directories relative to cwd, resulting in literal `$HOME/` folders.

Added make sync-plugin target for live plugin development
## Summary
Created a Makefile target that syncs source files to the plugin cache directory, enabling rapid iteration during plugin development without needing to reinstall.

## Changes Made
- Added `sync-plugin` to `.PHONY` targets
- Added "Plugin Development" section to help output
- Added `sync-plugin` target that:
  - Auto-detects installed version from cache directory
  - Uses rsync with appropriate excludes (`.venv`, `__pycache__`, etc.)
  - Provides clear feedback on sync status

Created formal spec project for Memory Consolidation from research documents
## Summary
Migrated research documents from `docs/research/CognitiveSubstrate/` into formal spec structure at `docs/spec/active/2025-12-27-memory-consolidation/`.

## Deliverables Created
- **REQUIREMENTS.md**: 11 functional requirements, 6 non-functional requirements including deep observability
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Component architecture, data flow, observability instrumentation by module, trace hierarchy
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: 220 tasks across 7 phases with no deferrals
- **README.md**: Project summary and metadata

## Key Design Points
- Deep observability at every level (not just hooks)
- 220 implementation tasks - no skipping, no deferring
- Feature-gated via pip extras `[consolidation]`
- Idempotent SessionStart summary injection
