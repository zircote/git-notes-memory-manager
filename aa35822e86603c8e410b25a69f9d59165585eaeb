Created GitHub issue #31 for PLUGIN_ROOT path resolution bug
## Summary
Investigated and filed comprehensive bug report for path resolution failures in marketplace-installed plugins. The issue affects 12+ command files and includes three solution options with recommendation.

## Changes Made
- Investigated 12+ affected command files
- Traced root cause to hardcoded namespace assumption
- Discovered secondary issue (missing scripts/ in distribution)
- Generated detailed issue report with file:line references
- Filed issue #31 to zircote/git-notes-memory

Skipped committing broken metrics.py script
## Summary
Reviewed pending changes and found only one untracked file (`.claude-plugin/scripts/metrics.py`) which uses a non-existent API (`get_metrics_registry`). Per user decision, skipped committing this broken file.

## Context
- The broken script is related to issue #31 filed earlier
- Issue #31 recommends using Python module imports instead of scripts
- The actual API is `get_metrics()` not `get_metrics_registry()`
