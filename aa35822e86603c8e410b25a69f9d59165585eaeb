Plugin cache is stale - 0.4.1 vs repo 0.12.0
## Summary
The `/memory:traces` command fails because the plugin cache has versions 0.3.1-0.4.1 while the repo is at 0.12.0. The command template references `scripts/traces.py` which doesn't exist in cached versions.

## Root Cause
Plugin cache at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/git-notes-memory/memory-capture/` hasn't been updated in many releases.

## Resolution
```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache/git-notes-memory/memory-capture/
claude plugins add .claude-plugin
```
