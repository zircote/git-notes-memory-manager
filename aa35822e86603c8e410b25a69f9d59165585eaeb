Plugin cache version mismatch causes command failures
## Summary
The `/memory:traces` command failed because the plugin cache contains v0.3.1 while the repo is at v0.12.0. The command template references `scripts/traces.py` which doesn't exist.

## Technical Details
- Plugin cache: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/git-notes-memory/memory-capture/0.3.1/`
- Repo version: v0.12.0
- Missing file: `scripts/traces.py`
- Traces are in-memory only (rolling buffer in `_completed_spans`)
