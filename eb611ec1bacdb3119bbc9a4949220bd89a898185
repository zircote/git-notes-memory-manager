Approved SPEC-2025-12-25-001 (LLM-Powered Subconsciousness)
## Context
The specification defines a comprehensive LLM-powered subconsciousness layer for autonomous memory management. After reviewing the 3,216 lines of specification across 6 documents, the spec demonstrates:
- Clear problem definition with 5 identified pain points
- Well-structured architecture with 7 components and 13 ADRs
- Detailed implementation plan with 85 tasks across 6 phases
- Grounded research foundation (CognitiveSubstrate, MemGPT, A-MEM)

## Decision
Approved the specification for implementation with formal approval recorded in README.md frontmatter and CHANGELOG.md.

## Rationale
- All required documents complete and comprehensive
- Clear success metrics with measurable targets (>70% acceptance, >30% redundancy reduction, etc.)
- Risk mitigation strategies documented for top 3 risks
- Architecture follows existing codebase patterns (frozen dataclasses, Protocol-based abstractions)
- LLM output templates ensure compatibility with existing note_parser.py format
- Phased implementation with verification gates enables incremental delivery
