Confirmed key architectural decisions for multi-domain memories
## Summary
User validated 4 critical design decisions from the open questions in GitHub Issue #13.

## Rationale
- **Storage**: Separate bare git repo at `~/.local/share/memory-plugin/user-memories/` - maintains git notes semantics for both domains
- **Conflicts**: Project memories override user memories - local context is more specific
- **Team domain**: Deferred to v2 - keep initial scope focused
- **Sync**: Optional remote auto-sync - configure remote and sync on session events

Approved multi-domain memories specification for implementation
## Context
Comprehensive specification for GitHub Issue #13 completed planning phase with full requirements, architecture, implementation plan, and architectural decisions documented.

## Decision Rationale
- **Complete documentation**: All required documents present (6 files, 1,556 lines)
- **Well-scoped**: 13 requirements split across 3 priority tiers
- **Clear architecture**: 7 ADRs document key decisions with user validation
- **Phased approach**: 5 phases with 24 discrete tasks
- **Risk mitigation**: Top 4 risks identified with concrete mitigations
- **Backward compatible**: Existing project memories continue unchanged

## Key Features Approved
1. Two-domain storage (user + project)
2. Separate bare git repo for user memories
3. Project memories override user (conflict resolution)
4. Optional remote sync for cross-machine use
5. Domain markers: `[global]` inline and `▶ global:namespace ───` blocks
6. SessionStart context includes both domains
7. Team domain deferred to v2
