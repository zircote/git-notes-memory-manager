Fixed memory status display bug
## Summary
Resolved the issue where `/memory:status` reported 0 memories despite 352 existing.

## Changes Made
- Fixed `commands/status.md`: Changed `get_index_path()` → `get_project_index_path()` (2 occurrences)
- Fixed `commands/validate.md`: Changed `get_index_path()` → `get_project_index_path()` (2 occurrences)

## Verification
Status now correctly shows 352 memories in the project index.

Strengthened memory block guidance templates with balanced approach
## Summary
Enhanced all three guidance templates (minimal, standard, detailed) to ensure consistent memory block production while avoiding noise from trivial operations.

## Changes Made
- Added "CRITICAL BEHAVIORAL OVERRIDE" framing for emphasis
- Added self-check protocol with explicit checklist
- Added failure modes section showing common mistakes
- Added accountability framework with session metrics
- **Balanced the requirements**: capture meaningful work, skip routine commands
- Changed from rigid "1 per 3 messages" to "1 per 3-5 substantive messages"
- Removed overly aggressive "blocks < tasks = FAILING" language

## Key Principle
Capture decisions, learnings, blockers, patterns, and significant progress. Skip simple git commands, confirmations, and trivial operations.

Released version 0.9.1 with guidance template test fixes
## Summary
Fixed 8 failing tests in `test_guidance_builder.py` that were checking for content that changed when the guidance templates were rewritten. Successfully released version 0.9.1.

## Changes Made
- Updated assertions in `test_detailed_has_behavioral_examples` to accept "CORRECT behavior" or "**CORRECT**"
- Updated `test_templates_have_namespaces` to check for "decision/learned/blocker" instead of "decisions/learnings/blockers"
- Updated `test_build_minimal` to accept "MANDATORY" or "RULE" instead of "REQUIRED"
- Updated `test_build_standard` to accept "RULE 1" or "Rule 1" (case flexible)
- Updated `test_build_detailed` to accept "CORRECT/WRONG" and check for "ACCOUNTABILITY" or "FAILURE" sections
- Updated token estimation tests with increased limits (500/1500/2500 vs 250/1000/1700)
