Fixed OTEL duplicate label issue by removing resource processor
## Summary
The test metric `memory_test_counter_total` successfully reached Prometheus with the namespace label. The duplicate label errors shown are from before the restart (17:51).

## Changes Made
- Removed `resource` processor from all pipelines in docker/otel-collector-config.yaml
- Python's OTLP exporter already sets resource attributes, so the processor was duplicating them

## Verification
- Export returned True
- Metric visible in Prometheus with correct labels
- No new duplicate errors after restart

Telemetry pipeline verified working end-to-end
## Summary
Simulated capture metrics are now visible in Prometheus. The OTEL duplicate label fix is confirmed working.

## Metrics Now Available
- `memory_memories_captured_total{namespace="decisions", status="success"}`: 1
- `memory_memories_captured_total{namespace="learnings", status="success"}`: 1
- `memory_hook_executions_total{hook="SessionStart", status="success"}`: 1
- `memory_capture_duration_ms{namespace="decisions"}`: 45.2ms

## Verification
Export returned True and Prometheus query shows the data.

Verified OTLP telemetry pipeline is fully functional
## Summary
The telemetry export pipeline works end-to-end. Test metrics successfully exported to Prometheus via OTEL Collector.

## Findings
- **Test metrics in Prometheus**:
  - `verify_pipeline_counter_total` = 1
  - `verify_pipeline_gauge` = 99
  - `verify_pipeline_histogram_sum` = 42.5
- **Pipeline flow confirmed**: Python → OTLP HTTP → Collector → Prometheus
- **Real metrics empty** because Stop hook hasn't run yet (exports at session end)

## Root Cause
Metrics are only exported when a session ends (Stop hook). Since this session is still active, real capture/hook metrics haven't been pushed to Prometheus yet.

Added real-time metrics export to all hooks and captures
## Summary
Modified all hook handlers and CaptureService to flush metrics to OTLP after each operation, enabling real-time observability instead of session-end-only export.

## Changes Made
- Added `flush_metrics_to_otlp()` helper to `hook_utils.py`
- Modified `capture.py:809-816` to export after each memory capture
- Modified `session_start_handler.py` to flush before exit
- Modified `user_prompt_handler.py` to flush before exit
- Modified `post_tool_use_handler.py` to flush before exit
- Modified `pre_compact_handler.py` to flush before exit
- `stop_handler.py` already had OTLP export

Implemented Issue #28 multi-worktree sync fix
## Summary
Replaced `push_notes_to_remote()` with `sync_notes_with_remote(push=True)` in the Stop hook to prevent race conditions in multi-worktree environments.

## Changes Made
- Modified `stop_handler.py:473-490` to use fetch→merge→push workflow
- Updated comments to reference Issue #28
- Changed logging to show per-namespace sync results

## Verification
- All 2860 tests pass
- 85% code coverage
- All quality checks pass
