Fixed OTEL duplicate label issue by removing resource processor
## Summary
The test metric `memory_test_counter_total` successfully reached Prometheus with the namespace label. The duplicate label errors shown are from before the restart (17:51).

## Changes Made
- Removed `resource` processor from all pipelines in docker/otel-collector-config.yaml
- Python's OTLP exporter already sets resource attributes, so the processor was duplicating them

## Verification
- Export returned True
- Metric visible in Prometheus with correct labels
- No new duplicate errors after restart
