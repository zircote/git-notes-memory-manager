Approved spec SPEC-2025-12-26-001 for implementation
## Context
After reviewing the complete specification for the multi-worktree sync fix (Issue #28), the spec was approved with all required documents validated.

## Rationale
- All 5 required documents present (README, REQUIREMENTS, ARCHITECTURE, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN, DECISIONS)
- Clear problem statement with race condition diagrams
- Minimal risk - using existing proven sync method from Issue #18
- Well-scoped: single-line code change with comprehensive testing plan
- 5 ADRs documenting key architectural decisions
