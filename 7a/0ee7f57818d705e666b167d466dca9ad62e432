- Traced root cause to hardcoded namespace assumption
- Discovered secondary issue (missing scripts/ in distribution)
- Generated detailed issue report with file:line references
- Filed issue #31 to zircote/git-notes-memory

Fixed OTEL duplicate label issue by removing resource processor
## Summary
The test metric `memory_test_counter_total` successfully reached Prometheus with the namespace label. The duplicate label errors shown are from before the restart (17:51).

## Changes Made
- Removed `resource` processor from all pipelines in docker/otel-collector-config.yaml
- Python's OTLP exporter already sets resource attributes, so the processor was duplicating them

## Verification
- Export returned True
- Metric visible in Prometheus with correct labels
- No new duplicate errors after restart

Telemetry pipeline verified working end-to-end
## Summary
Simulated capture metrics are now visible in Prometheus. The OTEL duplicate label fix is confirmed working.

## Metrics Now Available
- `memory_memories_captured_total{namespace="decisions", status="success"}`: 1
- `memory_memories_captured_total{namespace="learnings", status="success"}`: 1
- `memory_hook_executions_total{hook="SessionStart", status="success"}`: 1
- `memory_capture_duration_ms{namespace="decisions"}`: 45.2ms

## Verification
Export returned True and Prometheus query shows the data.
