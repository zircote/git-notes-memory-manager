v0.7.0 never published to PyPI despite workflow "success"
## Context
The GitHub Actions workflow #17 for v0.7.0 "completed in 45s" (vs normal 2+ min) but the version is absent from PyPI's release list. This indicates the publish step likely failed silently or was skipped.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Lightweight tag**: `v0.7.0` was created as a lightweight tag (type: `commit`) instead of annotated tag
2. **Fast completion**: 45 seconds is too fast for a full publish cycle (checkout → deps → tests → build → publish)
3. **Missing from PyPI**: Only 13 versions exist, jumping from 0.6.2 directly to 0.7.1
