Fix status command to use project-specific index path
## Context
The `/memory:status` command was reporting 0 memories because it used `get_index_path()` (global legacy path) instead of `get_project_index_path()` (current project-specific path).

## Rationale
- Per-project isolation was added to store indexes in `<git-root>/.memory/index.db`
- The status command wasn't updated to use this new path
- All memories (352) are safe in the project index

Confirmed: The `+` prefix in refspec is the standard solution
## Summary
The Git documentation confirms that the `+` prefix in a refspec tells Git to update the reference even if it isn't a fast-forward.

## Rationale
- Current code: `f"{base}/*:{base}/*"` - fetches directly to local refs, fails on divergence
- Correct code: `f"+{base}/*:refs/notes/origin/mem/*"` - fetches to remote tracking refs with force-update
- The `+` prefix allows non-fast-forward updates which is necessary for notes that diverge across machines
