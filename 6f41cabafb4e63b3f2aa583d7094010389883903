...hook detects markers in YOUR messages, not MINE.**

When you write `[decision] something` or `[learned] something` in your prompts, it gets detected. But the `▶ progress ───` blocks I write in my...

When project-specific index storage was added, commands were not updated
## Context
The memory system has two index paths:
- **Global (legacy)**: `~/.local/share/memory-plugin/index.db` - for cross-project use
- **Project-specific (current)**: `<git-root>/.memory/index.db` - for per-repo isolation

The `commands/status.md` and `commands/validate.md` files were using `get_index_path()` (global) instead of `get_project_index_path()` (project-specific).

## Evidence
| Location | Memory Count |
|----------|--------------|
| Git notes (`refs/notes/mem/*`) | 60+ note objects |
| Project index (`.memory/index.db`) | **352 memories** |
| Global index (`~/.local/share/memory-plugin/`) | 0 memories |

Issue #18 is AI-actionable with complete root cause analysis
## Summary
The issue precisely identifies the problematic code at `git_ops.py:731-742` where the fetch refspec `f"{base}/*:{base}/*"` fetches directly into local refs instead of remote tracking refs.

## Key Findings
- Current config: `refs/notes/mem/*:refs/notes/mem/*` (direct fetch)
- Correct config: `+refs/notes/mem/*:refs/notes/origin/mem/*` (tracking refs)
- The `+` prefix enables force-update for non-fast-forward cases
- A proper sync workflow (fetch → merge → push) is needed

## Related Files
- src/git_notes_memory/git_ops.py:700-766 (configure_sync function)
- commands/sync.md (only handles local index sync, not remote)
- commands/validate.md (no refspec validation)
