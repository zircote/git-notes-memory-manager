Completed Phase 3: Command Updates - both sync and validate commands updated
## Summary
Phase 3 of the git notes fetch refspec fix is complete. The `/memory:sync` and `/memory:validate` commands now support remote sync operations and refspec validation.

## Changes Made
- Updated `commands/sync.md`:
  - Added `--remote` flag parsing in Step 1
  - Added Step 4 for remote sync execution (fetch→merge→push)
  - Added remote sync dry-run support
  - Updated "When to Use" table with `--remote` mode
  - Added examples for remote sync commands
- Updated `commands/validate.md`:
  - Added Test 3: Remote Sync Configuration
  - Detects old vs new fetch refspec patterns
  - Offers migration via `--fix` flag
  - Renumbered subsequent tests (4-8 → 5-9)
  - Updated validation tests table
  - Added troubleshooting entries for refspec issues

Completed Phase 4: Hook Auto-Sync - opt-in remote sync via environment variables
## Summary
Phase 4 adds automatic remote sync capabilities that are opt-in via environment variables. This allows teams to automatically share memories without manual `/memory:sync --remote` commands.

## Changes Made
- Added `session_start_fetch_remote` and `stop_push_remote` config options to `config_loader.py`
- Added environment variable parsing for `HOOK_SESSION_START_FETCH_REMOTE` and `HOOK_STOP_PUSH_REMOTE`
- Added fetch+merge+reindex logic to `session_start_handler.py` (triggered when `session_start_fetch_remote=true`)
- Added push logic to `stop_handler.py` (triggered when `stop_push_remote=true`)
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new "Remote Sync (Team Collaboration)" section
