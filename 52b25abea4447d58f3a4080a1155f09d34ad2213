Git notes as source of truth, SQLite as derived queryable index
## Context
Core architectural decision for the memory storage system. Git notes provide distributed, versioned storage that syncs with code, while SQLite + sqlite-vec provides fast KNN search.

## Rationale
- Git notes are inherently distributed (push/pull with repos)
- Version history comes free with git
- Index can be rebuilt from notes (SyncService.reindex)
- sqlite-vec enables local semantic search without external APIs
