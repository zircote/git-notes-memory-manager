Created 3 comprehensive GitHub issues for git-notes-memory-manager
## Summary
- #10: Observability with tiered implementation (timing decorators → structured logging → OpenTelemetry)
- #11: Subconsciousness pattern with 5 LLM agents (implicit capture, consolidation, forgetting, surfacing, linking)
- #12: Secrets filtering with multi-layer defense (pattern, entropy, contextual detection)

LSP tool is now fully functional - race condition bug resolved
## Test Results
All LSP operations completed successfully:

| Operation | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| `documentSymbol` | ✓ Returned 70+ symbols from capture.py |
| `goToDefinition` | ✓ Navigated to CaptureService class definition |
| `hover` | ✓ Displayed full type signature and docstring for `capture()` method |
| `findReferences` | ✓ Found 15 references across 7 files for `get_default_service` |

## Context
The previous blocker (memory `blockers:98a774f:3`) noted LSP was unavailable due to a race condition in Claude Code v2.0.76. This appears to be fixed now.
