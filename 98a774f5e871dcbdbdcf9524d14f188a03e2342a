...management is **explicit and manual**:
- Users must explicitly capture memories with markers (`[decision]`, `[learned]`, etc.)
- Recall requires explicit search queries
- No automatic consolidation...

summary: Stick with hooks-based type checking until LSP is fixed
---

Stick with hooks-based type checking until LSP is fixed
## Rationale
- LSP tool is broken in Claude Code 2.0.69+
- Downgrading to 2.0.67 risks losing other fixes/features
- Current hooks already run pyright/mypy on every edit
- Hooks provide 80% of the value (error detection) without the navigation features

## Trade-off
Lose: go-to-definition, find-references, hover docs via LSP tool
Keep: Type error detection, lint checking, format-on-save
