summary: Session analyzer fix verified - block markers detected

The session_analyzer._parse_jsonl_transcript() method was not extracting
text from Claude's structured message format. Claude JSONL has:
  message.content = [{type: "text", text: "..."}, ...]

Fixed by iterating content blocks and extracting text where type == "text".
Now properly detects unicode block markers like ▶ decision ───.
