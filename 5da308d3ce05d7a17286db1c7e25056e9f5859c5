Git notes as source of truth, SQLite as derived queryable index
## Context
Core architectural decision for the memory storage system. Git notes provide distributed, versioned storage that syncs with code, while SQLite + sqlite-vec provides fast KNN search.

## Rationale
- Git notes are inherently distributed (push/pull with repos)
- Version history comes free with git
- Index can be rebuilt from notes (SyncService.reindex)
- sqlite-vec enables local semantic search without external APIs

Lazy loading via __getattr__ to avoid embedding model import penalty
## Context
The sentence-transformers embedding model adds 2-3 seconds to import time. SessionStart hooks must complete quickly (<5s) to avoid blocking Claude Code sessions.

## Rationale
- Defer all expensive imports until first use
- Factory functions (`get_capture_service()`) create singletons lazily
- Direct SQLite queries in session_start_handler avoid full IndexService initialization

Confidence-based tiered capture behavior (AUTO/SUGGEST/SKIP)
## Context
When detecting capture-worthy content, the system needs to balance automation with user control.

## Rationale
- ≥0.95 confidence → AUTO (capture silently, show notification)
- 0.70-0.95 → SUGGEST (show suggestion, user confirms)
- <0.70 → SKIP (no action unless explicit marker)
- Explicit markers like `[decision]` always treated as confidence 0.98-1.0

Adaptive token budget based on project complexity
## Context
SessionStart context injection must balance providing useful context without overwhelming Claude's context window.

## Rationale
- Simple projects (<10 memories): 500 tokens
- Medium (10-50 memories): 1000 tokens
- Complex (50-100 memories): 2000 tokens
- Full (>100 memories): 3000 tokens
- Proportional allocation: 50% blockers, 40% decisions, 10% actions
