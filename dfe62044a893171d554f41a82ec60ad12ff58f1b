...Negative:**
- User may need to explicitly reference global memory if project overrides
- Could mask important global learnings in some cases

**Neutral:**
- Requires careful result merging in RecallService

Comprehensive codebase analysis for multi-domain memories feature
## Summary
The existing architecture provides strong extension points for multi-domain support. Key findings from code review.

## Key Integration Points Identified

**1. CaptureService (capture.py):**
- Uses `git_ops` property which creates a GitOps for current repo
- Memory IDs are `{namespace}:{commit_sha}:{index}` - need new format for user memories
- `_repo_path` property gets current repo root - need to support user-memories path

**2. IndexService (index.py):**
- Already has `repo_path` column added in SCHEMA_VERSION 2 migration
- Can use this as discriminator OR add new `domain` column
- Search methods accept `namespace` and `spec` filters - add `domain` filter

**3. RecallService (recall.py):**
- `_get_git_ops()` creates single GitOps - need to support both project and user GitOps
- Search returns MemoryResult objects with distance scores
- `hydrate_batch()` uses git_ops for content retrieval

**4. Hooks Subsystem:**
- SignalDetector: Block markers `▶ namespace ───` already supported
- Need to add domain markers: `[global]`, `[project]`, `[user]`
- ContextBuilder: Currently queries single index - need to merge user + project results

**5. Sync (sync.py):**
- Already supports remote fetch/push patterns via completed refspec fix
- User-memories bare repo can use same patterns

CognitiveSubstrate research provides comprehensive theoretical foundation
## Summary
The existing research documents provide deep theoretical grounding and industry context that must inform the specification.

## Key Insights
1. **Dual-Process Theory (Kahneman)**: System 1 (fast recall) vs System 2 (deliberate verification) maps directly to the architecture
2. **Cognitive Architectures (SOAR, ACT-R)**: Base-Level Activation (BLA) concept from ACT-R informs decay/reinforcement scoring
3. **MemGPT/Letta**: Explicitly supports "conscious" and "subconscious" threads - validates the pattern
4. **Adversarial Robustness**: Research shows current RAG defenses are inadequate - security is differentiating
5. **A-MEM (Zettelkasten)**: Dynamic indexing and memory evolution outperforms MemGPT on multi-hop reasoning

Observability research complete - key patterns for implementation
## Summary
Research on Python observability best practices reveals clear patterns for optional dependencies and structured logging.

## Key Findings
- **OpenTelemetry**: Libraries should only depend on `opentelemetry-api`; SDK is application choice. Use `extras_require` for optional instrumentation.
- **Prometheus buckets**: Default 15 buckets (5ms-10s) suitable for web services; customize to align with SLOs (hook timeouts: 2s, 5s, 15s, 30s)
- **Structured logging**: structlog recommended for new projects - supports context binding, processors, and JSON output
