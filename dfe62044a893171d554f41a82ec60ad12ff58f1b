Completed analysis of existing codebase patterns and integration points
## Summary
Thoroughly analyzed the git-notes-memory codebase to understand architecture and extension points.

## Key Findings

### Service Layer Pattern
- Singleton via `ServiceRegistry` with `get_default_service()` functions
- Lazy initialization to avoid loading embedding model at import
- Dependency injection via constructor or setter methods

### Data Models
- All `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for immutability
- `Memory` is the core entity with id format `{namespace}:{commit_sha}:{index}`
- `MemoryResult` wraps Memory with distance score for vector search

### Database Schema
- SQLite with `sqlite-vec` extension for vector search
- Schema versioning with migration system
- 384-dimension embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- WAL mode for concurrent access

### Hooks Subsystem
- Stop handler already has `SessionAnalyzer` and `_auto_capture_signals()`
- Confidence-based auto-capture with configurable thresholds
- Integration points exist for implicit capture, transcript analysis

### Extension Points for Subconsciousness
1. `IndexService` - add decay/reinforcement metadata columns
2. `CaptureService.capture()` - hook for LLM-based enrichment
3. `Memory` model - extend with links and decay metadata
4. `SessionAnalyzer` - enhance with LLM for implicit capture
5. Hooks - add new agents for proactive surfacing, consolidation

Completed specification artifacts for LLM-powered subconsciousness feature (Issue #11)
## Summary
Created comprehensive specification documents for implementing an LLM-powered subconsciousness layer that provides autonomous memory management including implicit capture, consolidation, intelligent forgetting, proactive surfacing, and semantic linking.

## Artifacts Created
1. **REQUIREMENTS.md** - 23 functional requirements (P0/P1/P2), success metrics, user stories
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - 7 component designs, schema extensions, API design, integration points
3. **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - 6 phases with 85 tasks, verification gates, risk register
4. **DECISIONS.md** - 13 Architecture Decision Records documenting key trade-offs

## Key Design Decisions
- Provider-agnostic LLM client (Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama)
- Confidence-threshold auto-capture (>0.9 auto, 0.7-0.9 review)
- Bidirectional memory links with 5 relationship types
- Archive instead of delete for forgetting (audit trail)
- Async/non-blocking LLM calls in hooks
