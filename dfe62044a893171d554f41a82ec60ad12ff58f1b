Specification files lost - never committed
## Summary
The 7 specification files created during planning were deleted because they were never committed before switching branches.

## Context
Files created but not committed:
- README.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, DECISIONS.md, CHANGELOG.md
- RESEARCH_NOTES.md (created by subagent)

## Resolution
Can recreate from conversation context - all content is preserved in this session.
