Skipped committing broken metrics.py script
## Summary
Reviewed pending changes and found only one untracked file (`.claude-plugin/scripts/metrics.py`) which uses a non-existent API (`get_metrics_registry`). Per user decision, skipped committing this broken file.

## Context
- The broken script is related to issue #31 filed earlier
- Issue #31 recommends using Python module imports instead of scripts
- The actual API is `get_metrics()` not `get_metrics_registry()`

## Changes Made
- **CRIT-001**: Fixed SQLite connection leak in `index.py` - added proper cleanup with `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` on initialization failure
- **MED-001**: Fixed session hook connection cleanup in `session_start_handler.py` - added `try/finally` block
- **LOW-004**: Added composite index for `status+timestamp` queries in `index.py`
- **LOW-010**: Added warning logging for batch note fetch fallback in `git_ops.py`
- **HIGH-006**: Created comprehensive `docs/ENV.md` with all environment variables documented
- **HIGH-007**: Added CHANGELOG v0.12.0 entry with observability and secrets filtering features
- **Test Fix**: Fixed `domain=domain.value` parameter in Memory creation in `capture.py`
- **Lint Fix**: Moved logger initialization after imports in `git_ops.py`

## Verification Results
- **Tests**: 2,342 passed (100%)
- **Coverage**: 88.21% (exceeds 80% requirement)

Added proactive memory search guidance to SessionStart templates
## Summary
Updated all three guidance templates (minimal, standard, detailed) with RULE 5 encouraging Claude to search for relevant memories BEFORE modifying code, rather than relying solely on the ~5 generic memories injected at session start.

## Changes Made
- Added RULE 5: PROACTIVE MEMORY SEARCH to `guidance_standard.md` with when/how to search
- Added expanded RULE 5 to `guidance_detailed.md` with tables and code examples
- Added brief proactive search note to `guidance_minimal.md`
- Added failure mode warning for skipping proactive search in all templates
- Updated self-audit reminders to include proactive search check
- Updated test thresholds: standard 1500→1700 tokens, detailed 2500→2800 tokens

## Context
SessionStart uses a generic project name query that yields low relevance (~0.53). Task-specific queries yield much better results (~0.77+). This guidance encourages Claude to search for memories related to specific components/files before modifying them.

Local plugin installation verified and metrics command executed
## Summary
Successfully installed memory-capture plugin from local git-notes-memory marketplace. The plugin cache structure was resolved with `source: "./../"` workaround for the schema requirement.

## Changes Made
- Fixed marketplace.json source path: `"./"` → `"./../"` (schema requires `./` prefix but needs parent traversal)
- Verified plugin installation from local marketplace
- Metrics command works but shows empty collectors (expected for fresh session)

Fixed .claude/hooks.json to use portable $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
## Summary
Replaced all hardcoded absolute paths with the `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable so the hooks work for anyone who clones the repository.

- lint-check-on-edit: use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`
- typecheck-on-edit: use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`

Successfully installed memory-capture plugin from local git-notes-memory marketplace. The plugin cache structure was resolved with `source: "./../"` workaround for the schema requirement.

## Changes Made
- Fixed marketplace.json source path: `"./"` → `"./../"` (schema requires `./` prefix but needs parent traversal)
- Verified plugin installation from local marketplace
- Metrics command works but shows empty collectors (expected for fresh session)

Created GitHub issue #31 for PLUGIN_ROOT path resolution bug
## Summary
Investigated and filed comprehensive bug report for path resolution failures in marketplace-installed plugins. The issue affects 12+ command files and includes three solution options with recommendation.

## Changes Made
- Investigated 12+ affected command files
- Traced root cause to hardcoded namespace assumption
- Discovered secondary issue (missing scripts/ in distribution)
- Generated detailed issue report with file:line references
- Filed issue #31 to zircote/git-notes-memory

Skipped committing broken metrics.py script
## Summary
Reviewed pending changes and found only one untracked file (`.claude-plugin/scripts/metrics.py`) which uses a non-existent API (`get_metrics_registry`). Per user decision, skipped committing this broken file.

## Context
- The broken script is related to issue #31 filed earlier
- Issue #31 recommends using Python module imports instead of scripts
- The actual API is `get_metrics()` not `get_metrics_registry()`

- **LOW-004**: Added composite index for `status+timestamp` queries in `index.py`
- **LOW-010**: Added warning logging for batch note fetch fallback in `git_ops.py`
- **HIGH-006**: Created comprehensive `docs/ENV.md` with all environment variables documented
- **HIGH-007**: Added CHANGELOG v0.12.0 entry with observability and secrets filtering features
- **Test Fix**: Fixed `domain=domain.value` parameter in Memory creation in `capture.py`

Added proactive memory search guidance to SessionStart templates
## Summary
Updated all three guidance templates (minimal, standard, detailed) with RULE 5 encouraging Claude to search for relevant memories BEFORE modifying code, rather than relying solely on the ~5 generic memories injected at session start.

## Changes Made
- Added RULE 5: PROACTIVE MEMORY SEARCH to `guidance_standard.md` with when/how to search
- Added expanded RULE 5 to `guidance_detailed.md` with tables and code examples
- Added brief proactive search note to `guidance_minimal.md`
- Added failure mode warning for skipping proactive search in all templates
- Updated self-audit reminders to include proactive search check
- Updated test thresholds: standard 1500→1700 tokens, detailed 2500→2800 tokens

## Context
SessionStart uses a generic project name query that yields low relevance (~0.53). Task-specific queries yield much better results (~0.77+). This guidance encourages Claude to search for memories related to specific components/files before modifying them.

Added proactive memory search guidance to SessionStart templates
## Summary
Updated all three guidance templates (minimal, standard, detailed) with RULE 5 encouraging Claude to search for relevant memories BEFORE modifying code, rather than relying solely on the ~5 generic memories injected at session start.

## Changes Made
- Added RULE 5: PROACTIVE MEMORY SEARCH to `guidance_standard.md` with when/how to search
- Added expanded RULE 5 to `guidance_detailed.md` with tables and code examples
- Added brief proactive search note to `guidance_minimal.md`
- Added failure mode warning for skipping proactive search in all templates
- Updated self-audit reminders to include proactive search check
- Updated test thresholds: standard 1500→1700 tokens, detailed 2500→2800 tokens

## Context
SessionStart uses a generic project name query that yields low relevance (~0.53). Task-specific queries yield much better results (~0.77+). This guidance encourages Claude to search for memories related to specific components/files before modifying them.

Local plugin installation verified and metrics command executed
## Summary
Successfully installed memory-capture plugin from local git-notes-memory marketplace. The plugin cache structure was resolved with `source: "./../"` workaround for the schema requirement.

## Changes Made
- Fixed marketplace.json source path: `"./"` → `"./../"` (schema requires `./` prefix but needs parent traversal)
- Verified plugin installation from local marketplace
- Metrics command works but shows empty collectors (expected for fresh session)

- Traced root cause to hardcoded namespace assumption
- Discovered secondary issue (missing scripts/ in distribution)
- Generated detailed issue report with file:line references
- Filed issue #31 to zircote/git-notes-memory

Skipped committing broken metrics.py script
## Summary
Reviewed pending changes and found only one untracked file (`.claude-plugin/scripts/metrics.py`) which uses a non-existent API (`get_metrics_registry`). Per user decision, skipped committing this broken file.

## Context
- The broken script is related to issue #31 filed earlier
- Issue #31 recommends using Python module imports instead of scripts
- The actual API is `get_metrics()` not `get_metrics_registry()`

Completed CRIT-003: Moved user capture service to ServiceRegistry
## Summary
Replaced module-level `_user_capture_service` global with ServiceRegistry-based singleton management. Added `ServiceRegistry.has()` method for checking existence without auto-creating.

## Changes Made
- Created `UserCaptureService` subclass of `CaptureService` for distinct registry type
- Rewrote `get_user_capture_service()` to use `ServiceRegistry.has()` + `register()` pattern
- Added `ServiceRegistry.has()` method for non-auto-creating existence check

Completed all 4 CRITICAL severity findings from code review
## Summary
All 4 CRITICAL findings have been remediated:
- CRIT-001: Circuit breaker added to embedding service (resilience)
- CRIT-002: Secrets filtering integrated for LLM prompts (GDPR compliance)
- CRIT-003: User capture service moved to ServiceRegistry (thread safety)
- CRIT-004: Adversarial screening activated (prompt injection defense)

## Changes Made
- `src/git_notes_memory/embedding.py`: Added circuit breaker to `embed_batch()`, fixed type handling
- `src/git_notes_memory/subconsciousness/llm_client.py`: Integrated `SecretsFilteringService` before API calls
- `src/git_notes_memory/capture.py`: Created `UserCaptureService` wrapper, rewrote `get_user_capture_service()` to use ServiceRegistry
- `src/git_notes_memory/registry.py`: Added `has()` method for existence checking
- `src/git_notes_memory/subconsciousness/implicit_capture_agent.py`: Added `_screen_memories()` method and `adversarial_detector` field

## Test Coverage
- 14 new tests for circuit breaker (`tests/test_embedding.py`)

Completed SEC-H-002: API Key Exposure in Error Messages
## Summary
Added error message sanitization to prevent API keys from leaking into logs/exceptions.

## Changes Made
- Added `_sanitize_error_message()` helper function to both providers
- Patterns redact: API keys (sk-*, ant-*), long tokens, Bearer tokens, URLs with keys
- Applied sanitization to all SDK exception handlers in Anthropic and OpenAI providers
