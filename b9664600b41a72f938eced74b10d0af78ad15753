Memory index location is project-specific at .memory/index.db
## Context
Investigated why index showed 0 memories after sync reported 2692.

## Key Insight
The SyncService uses `get_project_index_path(repo_path)` which resolves to `.memory/index.db`, NOT `.git/memory-index.db` or the global `~/.local/share/memory-plugin/index.db`.

SessionStart memory retrieval is limited by design
## Key Factors
- `session_start_max_memories` config (default 30)
- Token budget split (60% learnings, 40% patterns)
- Semantic relevance filtering via embedding distance
- Project name used as search query

## Implication
Low relevance scores (0.53-0.58) indicate the project name alone isn't a strong semantic match. More specific queries during `/memory:recall` will find more relevant results.

Runtime memory retrieval uses context-specific queries
## Mechanisms
1. **PostToolUse hook**: Auto-searches using file path terms
2. **Explicit search**: I can query with specific task-related terms
3. **Slash commands**: `/memory:recall <query>` for user-initiated search

## Best Practice
Use task-specific queries (0.77 relevance) rather than generic project names (0.53 relevance). Before modifying code, search for related decisions/patterns/learnings.

## Gap Identified
I should proactively search memories when starting work on specific components, not just rely on SessionStart context.

Memory index location is project-specific at .memory/index.db
## Context
Investigated why index showed 0 memories after sync reported 2692.

## Key Insight
The SyncService uses `get_project_index_path(repo_path)` which resolves to `.memory/index.db`, NOT `.git/memory-index.db` or the global `~/.local/share/memory-plugin/index.db`.

SessionStart memory retrieval is limited by design
## Key Factors
- `session_start_max_memories` config (default 30)
- Token budget split (60% learnings, 40% patterns)
- Semantic relevance filtering via embedding distance
- Project name used as search query

## Implication
Low relevance scores (0.53-0.58) indicate the project name alone isn't a strong semantic match. More specific queries during `/memory:recall` will find more relevant results.

Runtime memory retrieval uses context-specific queries
## Mechanisms
1. **PostToolUse hook**: Auto-searches using file path terms
2. **Explicit search**: I can query with specific task-related terms
3. **Slash commands**: `/memory:recall <query>` for user-initiated search

## Best Practice
Use task-specific queries (0.77 relevance) rather than generic project names (0.53 relevance). Before modifying code, search for related decisions/patterns/learnings.

## Gap Identified
I should proactively search memories when starting work on specific components, not just rely on SessionStart context.
