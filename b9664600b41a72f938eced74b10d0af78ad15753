Skipped committing broken metrics.py script
## Summary
Reviewed pending changes and found only one untracked file (`.claude-plugin/scripts/metrics.py`) which uses a non-existent API (`get_metrics_registry`). Per user decision, skipped committing this broken file.

## Context
- The broken script is related to issue #31 filed earlier
- Issue #31 recommends using Python module imports instead of scripts
- The actual API is `get_metrics()` not `get_metrics_registry()`

Deep-clean code review and remediation complete - all findings resolved
## Summary
Completed comprehensive `/claude-spec:deep-clean --focus MAXALL` with 9 parallel specialist agents (Security, Performance, Test Coverage, Database, Code Quality, Documentation, Architecture, Resilience, Compliance). All critical and high-priority findings remediated, full verification passing.

## Changes Made
- **CRIT-001**: Fixed SQLite connection leak in `index.py` - added proper cleanup with `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` on initialization failure
- **MED-001**: Fixed session hook connection cleanup in `session_start_handler.py` - added `try/finally` block
- **LOW-004**: Added composite index for `status+timestamp` queries in `index.py`
- **LOW-010**: Added warning logging for batch note fetch fallback in `git_ops.py`
- **HIGH-006**: Created comprehensive `docs/ENV.md` with all environment variables documented
- **HIGH-007**: Added CHANGELOG v0.12.0 entry with observability and secrets filtering features
- **Test Fix**: Fixed `domain=domain.value` parameter in Memory creation in `capture.py`
- **Lint Fix**: Moved logger initialization after imports in `git_ops.py`

## Verification Results
- **Tests**: 2,342 passed (100%)
- **Coverage**: 88.21% (exceeds 80% requirement)
- **Formatting**: PASS
- **Linting**: PASS (ruff)
- **Type checking**: PASS (mypy strict)
- **Security**: PASS (bandit)

Added proactive memory search guidance to SessionStart templates
## Summary
Updated all three guidance templates (minimal, standard, detailed) with RULE 5 encouraging Claude to search for relevant memories BEFORE modifying code, rather than relying solely on the ~5 generic memories injected at session start.

## Changes Made
- Added RULE 5: PROACTIVE MEMORY SEARCH to `guidance_standard.md` with when/how to search
- Added expanded RULE 5 to `guidance_detailed.md` with tables and code examples
- Added brief proactive search note to `guidance_minimal.md`
- Added failure mode warning for skipping proactive search in all templates
- Updated self-audit reminders to include proactive search check
- Updated test thresholds: standard 1500→1700 tokens, detailed 2500→2800 tokens

## Context
SessionStart uses a generic project name query that yields low relevance (~0.53). Task-specific queries yield much better results (~0.77+). This guidance encourages Claude to search for memories related to specific components/files before modifying them.

Local plugin installation verified and metrics command executed
## Summary
Successfully installed memory-capture plugin from local git-notes-memory marketplace. The plugin cache structure was resolved with `source: "./../"` workaround for the schema requirement.

## Changes Made
- Fixed marketplace.json source path: `"./"` → `"./../"` (schema requires `./` prefix but needs parent traversal)
- Verified plugin installation from local marketplace
- Metrics command works but shows empty collectors (expected for fresh session)

Fixed .claude/hooks.json to use portable $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
## Summary
Replaced all hardcoded absolute paths with the `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable so the hooks work for anyone who clones the repository.

## Changes Made
- format-on-edit: use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`
- lint-check-on-edit: use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`
- typecheck-on-edit: use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`
- security-scan-on-edit: use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`
